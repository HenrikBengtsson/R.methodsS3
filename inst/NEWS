Package: R.methodsS3
====================

Version: 1.4.0 [2012-04-20]
o Now setMethodS3() sets attribute "S3class" to the class.
o Added argument 'export' to setMethodS3() and setGenericS3(), which
  sets attribute "export" to the same value.


Version: 1.3.0 [2012-04-16]
o Now only generic funcions are exported, and not all of them.
o Now all S3 methods are properly declared in NAMESPACE.


Version: 1.2.3 [2012-03-08]
o Now arguments '...' of setMethodS3() are passed to setGenericS3().


Version: 1.2.2 [2011-11-17]
o CLEANUP: Dropped example(getMethodS3), which was for setMethodS3().


Version: 1.2.1 [2010-09-18]
o BUG FIX: isGenericS3(), isGenericS4(), getGenericS3() and getMethodS3()
  failed to locate functions created in the global environment while
  there exist a function with the same name in the 'base' package.  
  The problem only affects the above functions and nothing else and it
  did not exist prior to R.methodsS3 v1.2.0 when the package did not yet
  have a namespace.  Thanks John Oleynick for reporting on this problem.
o BUG FIX: isGenericS3() and isGenericS4() did not support specifying
  the function by name as a character string, despite it was documented
  to do so.  Thanks John Oleynick for reporting on this.


Version: 1.2.0 [2010-03-13]
o Added a NAMESPACE.


Version: 1.1.0 [2010-01-02]
o Added getDispatchMethodS3() and findDispatchMethodsS3().


Version: 1.0.3 [2008-07-02]
o Renamed HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 1.0.2 [2008-05-08]
o Added getMethodS3() and getGenericS3().
o BUG FIX: isGenericS3() and isGenericS4() gave an error if 
  a function was passed.


Version: 1.0.1 [2008-03-06]
o Added paper to citation("R.methodsS3").
o BUG FIX: Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least) 
  some locale, e.g. 'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify 
  the ASCII alphabet is to list all characters explicitly, which we now
  do in all methods of the package.  See the r-devel thread 
  "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on 2008-03-05 for details.


Version: 1.0.0 [2007-09-17]
o Created by extracting setMethodS3() and related methods from the 
  R.oo package.  The purpose is to provide setMethodS3() without
  having to load (the already lightweight) R.oo package.  For 
  previous history related to the methods in this package, please
  see the history of the R.oo package.
